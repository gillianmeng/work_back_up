work_back_up
============
It is so cool to use github to write a work back up on line. I am too excited to write more at this time….
I am not a developer but I am a developer finder, actually I am a recruiter of App Annie, firstly using github for hunting front end team leaders for our intelligence/free product team. 

Speaking of App Annie, I want to talk more. We are currently 140+ people in 6 global offices, and growing at an exponential pace. Despite being headquartered in Beijing, we are the global industry leader in app store analytics and market intelligence with clients that include Nokia, Microsoft, EA, Glu, DeNA, SEGA, and Chinese companies like Tencent, Baidu, Renren and more. Growth has been amazing and we are looking build up our team in Beijing.

Anyone who saw this message, if you have any interest in pls feel free to take a peer on our job board (Link →http://www.appannie.com/jobs/) or you could reach out to me at gill@appannie.com, I am all open to talk.

I will use this place to write some working process and hoping I can become a real developer someday…….
